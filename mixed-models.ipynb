A bounce rate is a measure of how quickly someone leaves a website, e.g. the number of seconds after which a user first accesses a webpage from the website and then leaves. Most websites want individuals to stay on their websites for a long time as they are more likely to read another article, buy one of their products, click on some of the sponsored links etc. As such, it can be useful to understand why some users leave the website quicker than others. \n\nTo investigate the bounce rate of the website, we chose three locations in 8 counties in England, and got members of the public of all ages to undertake a survey/test questionaire. In the test we asked them to use our search engine to query for something they want to eat this evening. The search engine listed our website first, as well as other websites that would be returned. The users that clicked on our website were then timed and their bounce time recorded. We also recorded their age, and made a note of the county and location.\n\nWe have been asked by the website to work out if younger individuals are more likely to leave the website quicker."},{"metadata":{"_uuid":"a583a1a882a547cd37963cfb74e01a206dee9072"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### 1.

County was not we were interested in, but we recorded it as we were aware that our sampling methodology could lead to clustering in our data that could invalidate the linear model from before.
