I've looked at the number of trees in the forest, the depth of those trees, the size of the nodes of those trees and the number of features to random choose while building each tree.

Identifying this feature could be more important that your full model in some cases.\n\nTo examine the importance of my features, I can use the rf_feat_importance function from the fastai library. Determining a features importance is actually pretty straightforward. Say I wanted to determine how important 'year' was to my model. I can take the values of the year column and randomly reshuffle them. In doing this, I create a variable that has no relationship to the dependent variable.

I explored a number of other avenues (such as upsampling the data to improve predictive power--this did not work well) that didn't end up making it into this final post. Sometimes the technique just flat didn't work and other times it simply didn't make much of a difference.  That is the nature of data science, however. There are a lot of techniques out there, and you have to know when to use each one. More importantly, you have to be willing to scrape something you put a lot of work into because it's just not useful.

You may have noticed that while my accuracy improved, the AUROC(Area Under Receiver Operating Characteristic) did not. This is a more robust scoring metric that uses False Positive Rate and True Positive Rate to produce a more balanced view of your model performance. While accuracy flat out fails on data sets that are severely imbalanced (for instance, in medicine when dealing with rare diseases), AUC takes into consideration how many positive data points(in our case how a 'yes') were correctly identified as positive (also called TPR or Recall) and also how many negative data points('no's in our case) were incorrectly identified as positive ones. It's a little disappointing that AUROC didn't really improve, but I have a theory as to why that might be.\n\nWhen training my models, there was quite a bit of variability when training the same model multiple times. This is really bad. It probably has to do with the amount of data I have, but basically it means I can't trust how good my model is. I could retrain it and get a result that's significantly different. I think given more data this problem would go away, but it's also possible that I'd need to go back to the drawing board and reassess how I'm modeling this data.\n\nJust as quick, dirty test, I built the same model but using the full data set. I only have the oob score to evaluate with now, but the results seem pretty similar to the training/validation split. I can't be too unhappy with this quick analysis overall though. ~70% accuracy is decent for a couple hours of work. I'd love to hear how others are approaching this or similar problems. \n\nThanks for reading!"},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"8d1188c0-f099-44ee-9fca-d659cbc8e1ea","_uuid":"ad7ab1f11a24f8aea731a8a684077f4f9b7fe3ca","collapsed":true,"trusted":true},"cell_type":"code","source":"df, y, nas = proc_df(modeling_df, \"Attended\")\nm = RandomForestClassifier(min_samples_leaf = 5,\n                           max_features='log2', n_jobs=-1, oob_score=True)\nm.fit(df, y)\nprint(\"Training Acc:\", round(m.score(df, y),5)),\nprint(\"Out-of-Bag Acc:\", round(m.oob_score_, 5))","execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"metadata":{"_cell_guid":"3f637a3a-0a2d-4daa-bee7-f18501c5f75d","_uuid":"403847d68e5989b40dac5d7ae377aa0444a4c78f"},"cell_type":"markdown","source":""}],"metadata":{"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"name":"python","version":"3.6.4","mimetype":"text/x-python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"pygments_lexer":"ipython3","nbconvert_exporter":"python","file_extension":".py"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":1}
